      "The ONIOM method combines extrapolation from a smaller to system to a larger system and extrapolation from a less accurate method to a more accurate method. It is commonly used to study biomolecules where an active site can be defined on chemical grounds and the remaining molecule is treated as scaffolding that is not directly involved in bond making or breaking processes.\n",

      "Various heuristics^ are used when partioning molecules:\n",

      "Preferably do not cut across bonds at all, if cutting across bonds cut only across single bonds.\n",

      "We investigate whether it is possible to violate these heuristics and use ONIOM to study systems that are commonly thought of as delocalised, in particular we wish to apply ONIOM to graphitic nanofragments also known as polyaromatic hydrocarbons.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAHs have a long history of study within computational chemistry and were an example of an early success for the application of Huckel theory^. They continue to be of both practical and theoretical significance and constitute models for graphene sheets. If ONIOM could be applied to these systems it would allow a greater degree of accuracy per unit computational cost than could be achieved without hybrid methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to interest in providing additional computational methods for the study of graphene like materials there is also the more fundamental question of the nature and applicability of ONIOM itself. As multiscale moldelling of biological systems have grown in complexity we have seen the development of on the on the fly quantum mechanical calculations that intelligently combine clasiical forcefield based simulation with ab initio calculations as and when needed. The goal of intelligent simulations that are able to on the fly determine which regions are chemically significant and to apply relevant methods such that the required degree of accuracy is achieved at reasonable computational cost would enable a new generation of simulation tools drastically more powerfull than their predecessors. An investigation of the principles lying behind ONIOMs successful application and a refinement of the heuristics used such that they could be turned into an algorithm, would constitute a stepping stone towards these more intelligent simulations."

      "ONIOM is a method for combining multiple electronic structure methods to compute a generalised energy. It is often used to combine ab initio quantum computations with molecular mechanics though it can also to combine any combination of ab initio, semi empirical and fully empirical methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approach taken involves decomposing the potential surface for the system of interest into different regions that are treated at the different levels of theory. THe answers are then combined to give the ONIOM energy. For energy differences involving local changes of the molecule oniom can be used to compute a energy differences that are close in value to those achieved using a high level method on the entire system but at a substantially reduction in computational cost. There are hoever several guidelines that need to be taken into account in order to ensure meaningfull results. These heuristics have been laid out [] amongst and include generation of a model region of sufficient size by cutting single bonds. This is easy to rationalise given the requirement for locality for the method to work. In this investigation buoyed by results that appear to successfully apply onion to buckminster fullerenes and carbon nanotubes despite violating this rule, we examine application of oniom to graphitic nanofragments that by necessity require generating model regions by cutting across carbon carbon double bonds and on first sight appear to be unlikely candiates for oniom given the aromaticity and delocalised electronic structure associated with these systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The structure of this paper is laid out as follows: first ONIOM is formally introduced, as are graphene nanofragments and an overview of their electronic structure presented, then we present our hypothesis regarding application of oniom to these systems followed by presenting the results of several calculations investigating this hypothesis, finally we summarise and discuss the results.

However, we have some precendent for oniom usage in related systems given earlier work done on nanotubes [ref] and buckminster fullerenes [ref] although there is some indication that the degree of delocalisation present in graphitic sheets may be greater than these instances [ref]. We will first reproduce the plain DFT literature calculations [ref] for graphene nano fragment cycloadditions, then we will use these and additional B3LYP/6-31Gd calculations done to compute the transition state barrier height associated with these reactions as a benchmark for the applicability of the oniom method."
